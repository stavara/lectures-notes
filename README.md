# Lecture Notes

An interdisciplinary notebook of evolving notes and reflections.

This project brings together materials from lectures, independent study, and personal writings across a wide range of subjects — literature, art, mathematics, computer science, robotics, artificial intelligence, and more.  

The goal is to capture ideas in progress, explore connections between disciplines, and create a living archive of learning.
